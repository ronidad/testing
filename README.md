## Description
In recent years, Kenya has generally been considered to be a country that is safer for persons with Albinism within the East African community, a good indicator being Isaac Mwaura who became the first Kenyan Albinism to join parliament in 2013. The government has put across measures to improve the health standards of persons with albinism following the recommendation stated in a report from a research conducted in the year 2017.  As by the report, it was clearly stated that there was lack of access to healthcare, more particularly medical checkups and appropriate sunscreen to persons with albinism. The government was also using an estimated number of persons with albinism to distribute the sunscreen which was not reliable.
As stated in the previous paragraph, the government using the unreliable estimate to distribute health products probably affected a certain percentage of persons with Albinism. In the vision 2030, the government promised to “leave no one behind” and committed to start with “the further behind first”. The persons with albinism are among the further behind, having been left out of discourses on gender, disability and more especially on color that is intersecting their identities that are part of life with albinism. A survey was then conducted and the government went ahead and updated the new number of persons with albinism on 20th June 2018 to improve the distribution of support products across the country.
It is vital for the government to ensure equal distribution of the support products and also to include measures to ensure that the sunscreen provided is appropriate.  Therefore, this project aims at drawing insights that will be used to optimize the distribution of sunscreen and support products to persons with albinism over the counties and  countrywide.
